            Winter is coming means something bad is going to happen. It is a
            popular GOT saying used by fans of the show to warn that bad things
            are coming. In Game of Thrones, the saying is the House Stark's
            motto as they are situated in the North of Westeros and often hit
            hardest by cold winters. The phrase is commonly used in a cynical
            way to say that something negative is bound to happen, just like
            winter.

            Joffrey Baratheon is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and

            Martin, and its HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones.
            Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, he subsequently appears in A
            Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000).

          <p class="justifyText">
            Its mentioned in the books even more often. George Martin repeats
            the phrase on purpose, we should notice it, we should be alerted by
            it. We should suspect that it leads to something big. And it does.
            The Lannisters pride themselves on being rich and returning their
            debts. They pay their financial debts, they also pay generously for
            the favors done to them. But the debts are not just about money. The
            Lannisters never forget the offence and they pay for every insult,
            real or imagined, with a calculated cruelty. They are greedy, they
            believe they deserve everything and to get it they will cheat, steal
            and murder. The Lannisters won the throne by murder. Jaime killed
            Aerys. Tywin betrayed the king and murdered Rhaegars family. Not
            with his own hands but still. His daughter took Elias place, her
            children are kings and a queen in place of Rhaegars children. So now
            a debt is owed and only death may pay for life.

            If you've been living under a rock for the last few months then you
            may not have heard about HBO's latest show, A Game of Thrones. Named
            after and based upon the first book in Martin's saga, the show's
            first season was a huge success. Going forward the show will
            continue with the events of A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A
            Feast for Crows, the recently released A Dance With Dragons, and the
            unreleased final books in the series. As a result of the show's
            success, sales of the books have skyrocketed, and I have very much
            been caught up in the excitement. I started the first book right
            after finishing my exams in mid-April, and am currently halfway
            through the fourth book.

            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series
            created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an
            adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by
            George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The
            show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland,
            Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States
            on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes
            broadcast over eight seasons.Set on the fictional continents of
            Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and
            follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The
            first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of
            Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble
            families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for
            independence from whoever sits on it.

          <p class="justifyText">
            HBO seems to be running a ship tighter than any vessel that sails
            from the Iron Islands. We've been building for years toward the
            final showdown between the living and the dead and it couldn't have
            gone worse for the living in episode 3 during the Battle of
            Winterfell. Then, the highlight: with a mighty scream and some fancy
            knife work, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams), the trained assassin,
            plunged a Valyrian steel dagger into the Night King, disintegrating
            him and all of his deadly creations. If I knew that was going to
            happen, I would probably be blurting it out everywhere, unable to
            contain myself. Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B.
            Weiss appeared in an Inside the Episode documentary to reveal
            they've been keeping Arya's moment secret for three years. Three
            long, long years.

            Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of
            Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the
            fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos. The
            series follows several simultaneous plot lines.
